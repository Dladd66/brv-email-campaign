Subject: The retirement tax trap your advisor never mentioned

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Most retirement plans have a ticking tax time bomb built right in. Here's why:

Traditional retirement accounts force you to:
- Pay taxes on ALL withdrawals
- Take Required Minimum Distributions
- Accept higher tax brackets in retirement
- Leave a tax burden for your heirs

In "The Business Retirement Vault," I reveal a different approach - one that eliminates future tax liability while maintaining complete control of your money.
