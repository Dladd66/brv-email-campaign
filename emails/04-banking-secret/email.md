Subject: How banks really make their money (and how you can too)

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Ever wonder how banks consistently generate profits? They use a fascinating concept called "positive arbitrage" - and in my new book, I show how you can use the same strategy.

Imagine being able to:
- Access your capital anytime
- Continue earning returns on money you're using
- Create multiple streams of income simultaneously
- Do it all tax-free

This isn't theory - it's a strategy that's been working for decades.
