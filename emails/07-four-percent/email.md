Subject: Why the "4% retirement rule" could leave you broke

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

The famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals has a fatal flaw that could devastate your retirement plans.

Consider this: A $1 million portfolio following the 4% rule provides just $40,000 annually - before taxes. After taxes? You might be left with less than $2,600 monthly.

I show how to:
- Generate significantly more income
- Eliminate the tax burden
- Maintain control of your principal
- Create true financial freedom
