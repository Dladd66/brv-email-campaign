Subject: The "widow trap" that could cost your family thousands

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

There's a serious flaw in most retirement plans that few advisors discuss: the "widow trap."

When one spouse passes away, the survivor often faces:
- Higher tax brackets as a single filer
- Reduced Social Security benefits
- Forced retirement account distributions
- Increased Medicare premiums

In "The Business Retirement Vault," I reveal how to protect your family from this scenario while building tax-free wealth for generations.
